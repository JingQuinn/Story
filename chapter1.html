<h1>Chapter 1 - New Member for the family</h1>
    <p>
        After our sister's family moved out, the house suddently went very quite. Dave decided to get a dog, so we went online and got contact with the seller
        for German shepherd in town. I still remembered the day we went to picked the dog, they brought him to the living room, he looked so small and cute,
        even he was only three months old. We didn't looked at other puppy, straight way decided to bring him home. Dave had same German shepherd when he was
        only 7 years old, it called Max, he was a police retired dog, well trained, and always protected Dave. That's another reason we chosen German Shepherd,
        we also called him - Max.

        I back to work on that day, left Dave and Max at home. After 4 hours Dave came to my work place and told me that he had to came to town and got more
        stuffs to clean because Max was new to the home, and he peed in different spots in the house, Dave spend most time to clean. But we all really
        happy to have a new member for the family.
