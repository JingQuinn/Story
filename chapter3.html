    <h1>Chapter 3 -- Sickness</h1>
    <p>
        The day we got Max, we also got a small bag of dog food from the seller, and they told us to soak the food first, then fed it, and we
        can change to any food we want. First few days we used the same food, and we found out Max kept having diarrhea. We didn't know what to
        do, Dave remembered one of our neighbor has same German shepherd, so he went and asked for help.
