    <h1>Chapter 3 -- Sickness</h1>
    <p>
        The day we got Max, we also got a small bag of dog food from the seller, and they told us to soak the food first, then fed it, and we
        can change to any food we want. First few days we used the same food, and we found out Max kept having diarrhea. We didn't know what to
        do, then Dave suddenly remembered one of our neighbor has same German shepherd, so he went and asked for help.

        We never talked to her before, just knew that she owned few German shepherd. Edwina is really nice lady, special for the first time to meet stranger
        like us, she spent lots time to ask us questions and told us what to do. From her knowledge, we found out the food that seller used to fed Max which
        called Red Mill, it is not good food for puppy, they used it because the cheaper price. She also told us that German shepherd's stomach is very
        sensitive, we need to change food immediately, but before started new food, she suggested us to feed Max with chicken mixed with rice for few
        days, and check Max's poo every day. If the poo became solid, then we can add in the new dog food, but do not change straight way, have to add
        in slowly until dog food totally instead chicken and rice.
