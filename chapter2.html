 <h1>Chapter 2 -- Puppy period</h1>
 <p>
    That winter was the coldest winter in Ireland. Since we had Max, one of us need to get up early in the morning, fed him, put fire on in the sitting
     room, and played with him. If he felt tired, then we can all slept bit before go to work. We need to lock all room's doors, only left kitchen
     and hall for him, leave toy and enough water for him when we away.

     As a puppy, he need company, when we away in work, he must bored, one day Dave came home and found he chewed corner of the wall, and he continued
     doing it. Finally dave had to buy a bag of plaster to fix the wall, he left in the hall and planned to do it in the weekend. But the next day, when
     he came back, he opened the door and what a surprise for him. Max opened the plaster, and played with it, so the whole hall and kitchen's floor were
     full of plaster. Dave was angry, then he felt very funny. He took a picture and filmed it, then started cleaning.
